# Exercise 7: Some Counting

# Loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1
for numbers1 in range(0, 51, 1):
    print(numbers1)

# Loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1
for numbers2 in range(50, -1, -1):
    print(numbers2)

# Loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1
for numbers3 in range(30, 51, 1):
    print(numbers3)

# Loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2
for numbers4 in range(50, 9, -2):
    print(numbers4)

# Loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5
for numbers5 in range(100, 201, 5):
    print(numbers5)
