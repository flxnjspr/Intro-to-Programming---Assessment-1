# Exercise 2: Simple Sums

first_number = 8    # Declaring a first variable and giving an integer value

second_number = 10      # Declaring a second variable and giving an integer value

result = first_number + second_number      # Declaring a third variable that sums up the first and second variables

print(sum)     # Printing the result of first and second number
